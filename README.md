Maxine
======

An interval practice tool. Uses the Sion library, for full licence see license.txt

Maxine works in a similar way to a memory game, presenting the user with intervals then awaiting a response. 

Presently, Maxine is in pre-alpha stage, because it currently does not make any sounds.

To help : incorporate the Sion library, make difficulty scale, give better instructions to the user per try, determine end game.
